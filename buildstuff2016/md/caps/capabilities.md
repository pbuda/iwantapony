## Capabilities

> A capability is an unforgeable token that (a) designates an object and (b) gives the program the authority to perform a specific set of actions on that object.

Note:
In case of Pony object reference is such token.

Pony has no pointer arithmetics, so it's unforgeable.

Decentralized security

No ACL, no permission lists - you have an object, you can do certain things with it

Tokens are revocable

Object references are tokens as you cannot forge a reference.
