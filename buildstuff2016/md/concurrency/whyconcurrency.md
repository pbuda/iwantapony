## Why do we need it?

- Because code runs in parallel we can get:
  - efficiency
  - scalability

Note:
Making our code concurrent alone doesn't give us any real benefits.

However we discussed that it allows our code to run in parallel or scheduled way.

This in turn can give us important benefits.

We don't want our processors to sit idle, that would be inefficient.
But since we can run those tasks in parallel on multiple processors - that gives us efficiency.

Moreover we can add more processors to increase throughput proportionally.
