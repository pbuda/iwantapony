## Share nothing

- perfectly concurrent
- scales perfectly
- limited use

Note:

Concurrent problems occur when we share data.

When we don't share data, everything works great, is perfectly concurrent, scales perfectly
but it alone doesn't have many uses.

I heared that erlang has a concept of share nothing and data is exchanged via messages.
But this requires other concept to work which is the actor model.
