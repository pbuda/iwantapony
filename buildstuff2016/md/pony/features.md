## Pony language features

- classes, actors, primitives
- nominal and structural subtyping
- object literals and lambdas
- generics
- pattern matching
- C FFI
- per actor, concurrent garbage collection

Note:
Primitives are similar to classes but have no fields and there's only one instance
ever defined.

Nominal subtyping is about names

Structural subtyping is about structure

I'll show examples at the end if time allows

FFI - Foreign Function Interface allows to call native code generated from other languages.

Garbage collection is concurrent, no stop-the-world gc pauses
